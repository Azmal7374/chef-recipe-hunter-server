Here I must mention we cook rice by the water separation method, similar as cooking pasta. If you follow the absorption method or cook rice using a rice cooker then make sure you take them out before all the water is absorbed or the hog plums will get stuck to rice. Once they are softened take them out and mash as much as possible with salt as per taste and sugar. It should not be very sweet rather there should be a good balance between sweet-sour-salty-and heat from chilies. So mash the chillies next and serve as an accompaniment with rice or khuder bhat (Bengali style broken rice congee).",
